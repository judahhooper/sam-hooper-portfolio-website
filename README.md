// Sam Hooper Portfolio Website //

The goal of this website is to create a multi page website to display the work of a professional photographer and act as a place for him to attract and retain clients.

This will also act as my first website. I'm trying to use a healthy combo of HTML, CSS and JS. I also used Highway and Tween for transitions. All code is my own :)
